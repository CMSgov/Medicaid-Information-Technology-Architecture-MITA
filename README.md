# Welcome to MITA and its Governance Board

The purpose of this repository is to re-introduce [MITA 3.0 Framework](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-systems/medicaid-information-technology-architecture/medicaid-information-technology-architecture-framework/index.html) to states and keep stakeholders abreast of the work being done by the [MITA Governance Board (MGB)](https://github.com/CMSgov/Medicaid-Information-Technology-Architecture-MITA-Repository-Staging/blob/main/MITA_Governance_Board_Overview.html).

MITA 3.0 is the latest major release of MITA, a framework and an initiative to establish national guidelines for technologies, information, and processes that will enable a standard approach to Informational Technology (IT) implementations for state Medicaid Enterprise Systems. MITA is included in sub-regulatory guidance to ensure state Medicaid IT projects align with national-level program goals and best practices.
